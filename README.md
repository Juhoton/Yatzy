# Yatzy

Made for the course Programming practical work(ohjelmoinnin jatkokurssi). It is a working Yatzy game made from python and tkinter. 

It is a scuffed one file program where App.py contains everything. Was way out of scope for the course project requirements, but wanted to learn how to make an actual program that runs separate from a code editor.
