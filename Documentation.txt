Main menu and Game GUI done, but the functionality is still missing. 

aiming to finish by wednesday 21.12.2022

21.12.2022 Update:
Added dices into game gui. game gui still missing roll button and some text for instructions.
Waaaayy too much to learn and problem solve to complete project today.
Still missing:
-Game logic
-Scene changing
-functionality for the buttons and checkbuttons in gamegui and main menu
-way to save game. Aiming for pause menu with pressing esc, but still to be figured
-SavedGamesGUI
-some other stuff prob.

everything doable, but it just takes time and patience.

aiming to finish by somewhere the week after Christmas.
